/**
 * Interface class for Festo Double Action pneumatic valve.
 * Double action is a sliding valve. Calling open applies power to the open side momentarily causing
 * the valve to move to the open position. Power is then turned off and the valve
 * stays where it is (open). Calling close applies power to the close side momentarily causing the
 * valve to move to the closed position. Power is then turned off and the valve
 * stays where it is (closed).
 * 
 * Open and Close are arbitrary definitions, they are actually defined by the physical robot
 * valve piping/wiring and what you want the cylinder to do. Typically you would pipe the "open" side
 * of the valve to extend a cylinder and close to retract. For VEX valves, our convention is to wire
 * the A side to the first port and pipe to open or extend the cylinder and B side to close or retract.
 * Again, these are conventions and the reality is what you design your valve to cylinder piping to be
 * and the wiring to the corresponding sides of the valve to the PCM ports.
